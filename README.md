- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulaTeeuwen
- 👀 I’m interested in virtual screening of molecular building blocks for their self-assembly into supramolecular cages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of coding and github, construction of supramolecular structures using stk and the generation of molecules using machine learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the generation of focused molecules using machine learning and possibly transfer learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: pcpt3@cam.ac.uk
